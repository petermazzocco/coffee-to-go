# coffee-to-go ☕️

`coffee-to-go` is a CLI tool for learning Golang through examples of managing and ordering coffee from a coffee shop.
This tool provides simple examples of Golang concepts and best practices. It started out as a way for me to personally
learn Golang concepts in ways that made the most sense to me. I hope that this tool can help others learn Golang in a
way that makes sense to them as well.
